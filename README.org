Welcome to  the land  of silly  witticisms and  shamelessly stolen,  banged up
semi-working snippets  of obscure code,  where lame jokes and  dark references
run galore.

This repository is  a strictly personal collection of  loosely coupled, mostly
failed  experiments and/or  thoughts.  I  try to  keep everything  filterless,
meaning I dump  whatever I have on my  mind at the time of  writing, which can
consist of  sometimes extremely  basic explanation  that a  2 year  old should
already be aware of.

Enough with the poor  banter, this here is my meager  attempt at rebuilding my
dotfiles following the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate programming]]  paradigm.  Being a sucker for the
darker parts of computer science culture, history, and discipline, I feel this
is the  perfect opportunity  to learn a  new paradigm and  to get  myself more
acquainted to  the inner workings  of [[https://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/][Emacs]]  and [[https://orgmode.org/][Org-mode]] following  my recent
shift from the [[https://neovim.io/][dark side]].

* Installation

This repository contains  multiple dotfiles for multiple  programs. Luckily, I
have provided handy script  to install one, many, or all of  those at the same
time.  But  first, selfies be  damned, clone the  repository using one  of the
below commands. Come on, you should know this.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone git@github.com:chaoticmurder/dotfiles.git
git clone https://github.com/chaoticmurder/dotfiles
#+END_SRC

Or, if you prefer GitLab, like myself.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone git@gitlab.com:chaoticmurder/dotfiles.git
git clone https://gitlab.com/chaoticmurder/dotfiles
#+END_SRC

No  need  to back  up  your  configuration, the  setup  script  takes care  of
everything for you automatically.

Assuming you already =cd='ed into the resulting folder, the rest is a simple

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./dotfiles install [whatever you want to install]
#+END_SRC

So if you want to install just the emacs dotfiles, you'd use

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./dotfiles install emacs
#+END_SRC

... or many things

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./dotfiles install emacs,neovim,tmux
#+END_SRC

... or everything at once

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./dotfiles install all
#+END_SRC

Well, install is a big word. All this script does is (/implicitely backup your
configuration,  if  it  exists  then/)   create  symlinks  to  the  respective
configurations of  the given programs.   This is so there  is no need  to keep
separate  configurations  since  every  change is  reflected  into  the  local
repository.  The included ~.gitignore~ file also takes care of, well, ignoring
packages, cache files and all sorts of garbage to keep your code clean.
