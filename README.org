Welcome to  the land  of silly  witticisms and  shamelessly stolen,  banged up
semi-working snippets  of obscure code,  where lame jokes and  dark references
run galore.

This repository is  a strictly personal collection of  loosely coupled, mostly
failed  experiments and/or  thoughts.  I try  to  keep everything  filterless,
meaning I dump  whatever I have on my  mind at the time of  writing, which can
consist of  sometimes extremely  basic explanation  that a  2 year  old should
already be aware of. Whatever is written should be taken with a grain of salt.

Enough with the poor  banter, this here is my meager  attempt at rebuilding my
dotfiles following the  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate programming]] paradigm. Being a  sucker for the
darker parts of computer science culture, history, and discipline, I feel this
is the  perfect opportunity  to learn a  new paradigm and  to get  myself more
acquainted to  the inner workings  of [[https://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/][Emacs]]  and [[https://orgmode.org/][Org-mode]] +following  my recent
shift from the [[https://neovim.io/][dark side]].+ Scratch that, I couldn't in the end ... The literate
programming part still stands true.

* Installation

  This repository contains multiple dotfiles for multiple programs. Luckily, I
  have provided handy script to install one, many, or all of those at the same
  time. But  first, selfies be damned,  clone the repository using  one of the
  below commands. Come on, you should know this.

  #+begin_src shell
git clone git@github.com:scheatkode/dotfiles.git
git clone https://github.com/scheatkode/dotfiles
  #+end_src

  Or, if you prefer GitLab, like myself.

  #+begin_src shell
git clone git@gitlab.com:scheatkode/dotfiles.git
git clone https://gitlab.com/scheatkode/dotfiles
  #+end_src

  No  need to  back up  your  configuration, the  setup script  takes care  of
  everything for you automatically.

  Assuming you already =cd='ed into the resulting folder, the rest is a simple

  #+begin_src shell
./dotfiles install [whatever you want to install]
  #+end_src

  So if you want to install just the emacs dotfiles, you'd use

  #+begin_src shell
./dotfiles install emacs
  #+end_src

  ... or many things

  #+begin_src shell
./dotfiles install emacs,neovim,tmux
  #+end_src

  ... or everything at once

  #+begin_src shell
./dotfiles install all
  #+end_src

  Well, install  is a big  word. All this  script does is  (/implicitely backup
  your configuration,  if it  exists then/) create  symlinks to  the respective
  configurations of the  given programs. This is  so there is no  need to keep
  separate  configurations since  every  change is  reflected  into the  local
  repository. The included ~.gitignore~ file  also takes care of, well, ignoring
  packages, cache files and all sorts of garbage to keep your code clean.
